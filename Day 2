Title: Kagebushin-no-Jutsu or Shadow Clone 

Statement:
There will be two inputs x, y (initial amount of chakra and the number of spy ninjas).
In Shadow Clone Jutsu, the user can make multiple clones but their chakra is divided among them.
Now the user needs to use the Jutsu to stop all the spies from escaping with some top-secret info. So the user has to make at least y clones and the chakra in each clone will be x/y.
Now if the chakra gets below 1, the user will die and will be unable to stop the infiltration.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains 2 integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000) — where x is the initial amount of chakra, and y is number of spy ninjas.

Output:
For each of the t test cases, print "YES" if the user doesn't dies and stops the infiltration else print "NO". 

Example:
input:
4
12 6
20 10
3 4
4 3

output:
YES
YES
NO
YES
