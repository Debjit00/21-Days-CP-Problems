Statement:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer k. A substring is considered "unstable" if it contains at least one vowel and at least one consonant. Your task is to find the number of distinct "unstable" substrings of length k for multiple test cases.

Note: A vowel is defined as one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', while all other letters are consonants.

1 ≤ k ≤ ∣s∣ ≤ 10^6 (total length of all strings across test cases will not exceed 10^6)

Input:
The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5).
The second line contains the integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ |s|).

It is guaranteed that the sum of length of strings over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output:
For each test case, print the number of distinct "unstable" substrings of length k.

Example:
Input:
2
aeiouxyz
3
abcde
2

Output:
2
2
