Statement:
You are given an array a of unique integers. Your task is to choose two indices in the array such that the values at these indices have an absolute difference of exactly 1 (i.e., one value is one more than the other). Once you find such a pair, you must remove one of these two elements from the array.
Repeat this process until you can no longer find any such pairs. Finally, return the modified array, ensuring that no two adjacent values are present in the final array.

Input:
The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the array.
The second line contains n unique integers a1,a2,…,an​ (1 ≤ ai≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2×10^5 .

Output:
For each test case, output the size of the  modified array containing the minimum number of values such that no two adjacent values are present.
