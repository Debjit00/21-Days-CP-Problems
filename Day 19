Statement:
A number x is called k-prime if x has k distinct prime factors.
Example - 140 is a 3-prime because it has 3 distince prime factors are 2, 5, and 7.

Find the number of k-primes from 1 to N.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^5) - the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= 200).

Output:
For each test case, print the number of k-primes from 1 to n.

Sample:
input:
4
